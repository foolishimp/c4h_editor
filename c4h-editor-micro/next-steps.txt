# Next Steps for C4H Editor Migration

Now that the basic project structure is set up, you need to run the following scripts in order:

1. Run the script to set up shared package:
   ```
   python 2_setup_shared.py
   ```

2. Run the script to set up the config-editor microfrontend:
   ```
   python 3_setup_config_editor.py
   ```

3. Run the script to set up the shell application:
   ```
   python 4_setup_shell.py
   ```

4. Install dependencies and start the application:
   ```
   cd c4h-editor
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

After completing these steps, you should have a fully functional microfrontend architecture.
